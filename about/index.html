    <h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><h2 id="Why-did-I-created"><a href="#Why-did-I-created" class="headerlink" title="Why did I created?"></a>Why did I created?</h2><p>First of all, I created this website for self-learning. As an Information &amp; Communication Technology student, I’m always eager to find out more useful tools to build a wonderful website. I was recommended to try hexo-A fast, simple &amp; powerful blog framework. That’s why I started my blogs. After that, we all know that all Hong Kong must complete the SBA(School Based Assignment) task, in terms of ICT, we need to build a website and do lots of research in order to get a better result in DSE. Also, it is basically testing your learning attitude.</p>
<h2 id="What-can-you-find"><a href="#What-can-you-find" class="headerlink" title="What can you find?"></a>What can you find?</h2><p>I mostly write about computer science. I love languages and mathematics as well so you can find various poems about them. I’m greedy to learn all the knowledge in the world. However, apart from memorizing, our brains are also good at forgetting things. That’s why a great note is essential and required. Even though the fundamental content is not written by me, I still learn from it, and that’s the point. We just change the form to digital.</p>
<h2 id="Who-am-I"><a href="#Who-am-I" class="headerlink" title="Who am I?"></a>Who am I?</h2><p>I come from Hong Kong-a beautiful city. I enjoy studying ICT, physics and mathematics. I haven’t attended my public exam yet. I have to be honest to tell you that I have six girlfirends. Ok, it’s definitely not a fact though. Hold on a sec, I did have a girlfriend before.</p>
<h2 id="How-can-you-help-me"><a href="#How-can-you-help-me" class="headerlink" title="How can you help me?"></a>How can you help me?</h2><p>If you are my fan, then I’m pretty sorry. Up to now, there is no way to support or donate to me. I have no profit from making this. But at least you can share this website.</p>
<h1 id="Information"><a href="#Information" class="headerlink" title="Information"></a>Information</h1><h2 id="Title"><a href="#Title" class="headerlink" title="Title"></a>Title</h2><p>We are living in a world full of information. Specifically, Information is the resolution of uncertainty; it answers the question of “what an entity is” and thus defines both its essence and nature of its characteristics. The concepts may seem a little abstract. But, let’s zoom in one definition:  facts about a situation, person, event, etc. Information is always in our daily life. “What news today?” “Where she go?”… These questions are examples of asking for information. Generally, we ask these questions all the time. It is conceivable that information plays an important role in our life. Nowadays, with the prevalence of the internet, we can almost find all the information we need, ranging from news to mathematical theorems.</p>
<p>The technology has had a great influence on information spreading. We could only transmit the information through face-to-face activities in the past. For example, teachers needed to meet students directly, otherwise, no alternatives were given. During the COVID-19 outbreak, online teaching has experienced a surge of increase in requirement. The COVID-19 has resulted in schools shut all across the world. Globally, over 1.2 billion children are out of the classroom. With technology, teachers are enabled to teach students by using Zoom, Google Classroom, and so on.</p>
<h2 id="Statistics"><a href="#Statistics" class="headerlink" title="Statistics"></a>Statistics</h2><p>To show how significant it is, let’s go through the visits of Wikipedia. As of May 2015, the total number of Wikipedia page views, meanwhile, is at 19.545 billion. For another example, the biggest search engine, Google comes out to 228 million searches per hour, 5.6 billion searches per day, or 2 trillion searches per year. It seems that people have become more reliant on the internet, especially when they need to search for information.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we also find some data on “How Much Time Do People Spend on Social Media?” This could clearly show the exponential increase of the eagerness. According to research, Internet users spend an average of 2 hours and 22 minutes per day on social networking in 2019(Social media is also a way to get different information, such as the recent status of friends or reading some advertisements). Sleep accounts for one-third of the day, which means we only have 16 hours to work. In addition to other works, like meals or traveling time, our total working time is only approximately half of the day. Combine all these factors, we could understand that 2 hours is a gigantic number.</p>
<h2 id="Use-of-Information"><a href="#Use-of-Information" class="headerlink" title="Use of Information"></a>Use of Information</h2><h3 id="Analyzing-data"><a href="#Analyzing-data" class="headerlink" title="Analyzing data"></a>Analyzing data</h3><p>Information is associated with data. We can analyze the data and conclude it into information. For instance, imagine you are doing research and try to understand “how smartphones affect teenagers’ health”. First, you will gather the data from teenagers for pieces of evidence. Then, built the conclusion with the help of data. As we can see, the process of the first step is getting data. The second step is examining the data and turning it into information. When you finish all the research, you will realize how smartphones affect teenagers’ health. Thus, information is also related to knowledge, as knowledge signifies understanding of an abstract or concrete concept. </p>
<p>In terms of communication, information is expressed either as the content of a message. Universally, we have two stakeholders: the communicator and the receiver. The communicator is someone who can talk about their ideas and emotions in a way that other people understand. The receiver is someone who is receiving the information. The best way now to spread information is to post the information on a website so that receivers could always search the information in the search engine which is widely used. </p>
<p>Sometimes the information might not be clear enough, after the communicator transfer the information, the receiver would interpret the information and make it understandable. For example, information may be encoded into a sequence of signs or transmitted via a signal. It can also be encrypted for safe storage and communication. In other expressions, the original language is not readable for the receiver and it requires translation.</p>
<h3 id="Data-Types"><a href="#Data-Types" class="headerlink" title="Data Types"></a>Data Types</h3><p>In computer science and computer programming, a data type or simply type is an attribute of data that tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data. Most programming languages support basic types of integer number, floating-point number, strings, characters and Booleans(fundamentally Ture or False), and so on.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, we are unlikely to touch this sort of data type unless you are studying computer science. Instead, we see various information in daily life. Such as some advertisements which are hanging in the stations and placing on the website. These “posters” are the example of using images to publicize information. Why using images but not documents only? For all practical purposes, images are found more attractive than a bland document. Not only images, but we also can watch some videos on Youtube. These videos could comfortably spread information in detail and not as boring as a paper. Apart from that, we also get some animations on websites that expect users to stay on the website. All these elements are called multimedia which have already been proved that it can efficiently appeal to receivers.</p>
<h2 id="Prevalence-of-internet"><a href="#Prevalence-of-internet" class="headerlink" title="Prevalence of internet"></a>Prevalence of internet</h2><h3 id="Features"><a href="#Features" class="headerlink" title="Features"></a>Features</h3><p>The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It provides a very fast and cost-effective means of communication and information sharing and offers a wide range of information and data. One of the popular examples is to send emails to other people. Such emails sent are received almost immediately by those it is sent to. The receivers would need to download it.</p>
<p>The origins of the Internet date back to the development of packet switching and research commissioned by the United States Department of Defense in the 1960s to enable time-sharing of computers. And now it has been very common to see everyone around the world are using the internet to cope with different tasks. In 2015, the International Telecommunication Union estimated about 3.2 billion people, or almost half of the world’s population, would be online by the end of the year. Of them, about 2 billion would be from developing countries, including 89 million from least developed countries.</p>
<h3 id="Advantages"><a href="#Advantages" class="headerlink" title="Advantages"></a>Advantages</h3><p>It is very convenient now. Just a few steps and you can check the information you want: Open a laptop or a computer or even a phone. Then go to the search engine and enter the key terms. A vast number of websites will soon appear and tell us all the information. </p>
<p>Firstly, we are living in a fast-paced city, website searching saves lots of time. For students, who need to finish their uncountable essays and projects, it is the easiest way to go. Find some examples and put them into their poems effortlessly and they could complete rapidly. For office workers, there is a lot of documents which need to deal with. With the internet, copy the content of the letter and soon paste to their letter, helps them to finish their job without a hitch. It is no doubt that the ubiquity of the internet helps people to gather information straightforwardly. </p>
<p>Secondly, there is no one but longs to gain knowledge. The internet allows people to receive more and more knowledge on different websites. Now everyone can visit Wikipedia and read various poems, ranging from literature to science. It is not only well-packed but also versatile for every people. Moreover, with online social media and social networking services become popular, people tend to spend much time browsing pages from social media. Usually, these pages contain a lot of sharings or experiences whether is having a good or bad influence. Some teaching organizations love to open the page here so that people can learn something. Consequently, people can get more useful information and have a higher standard of knowledge. Moreover, this way is unlike the book, it always has better visual effects which is more captivating than a piece of paper. </p>
<h3 id="Drawbacks"><a href="#Drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks"></a>Drawbacks</h3><p>Even though we find several benefits on the internet. It still leaves much to be desired. Let me explain in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p>Since the fastness and convenience of the internet are so appealing to humans, they are more reliant on this wonderful tool. In tradition, people used to go to the library and borrow books for reference. The information in the books has already been strictly examined and censored by professionals. Thus, people can rest assured to use this information. However, in the digital world, information is enormous. It is impossible to check all of those. Some misleading information always on the internet. If people read these “bad” information without thinking it, the wrong information could spread even far away and it is not a suitable approach to learn new knowledge. Especially, nowadays children could also own an electronic gadget, they are not able to distinguish the information and this wrong information will ruin their lives. Certainly, most of this information may be accurate and correct. But still, it is not easy to differentiate abundant information. It still has much room for improvement. However, it still has some effective methods to help us distinguish the information. I would like to introduce in the next section.</p>
<p>But there is a more serious problem, the spreaders who spread this misleading information. As above mentioned, people are extremely hard to determine whether the information is suitable. If they trapped in a confined internet service, they will only hear the information from a purposeful authority that might want to control their people. China is one of the examples, the Chinese are not able to get rid of the internet controlled by the government. After that, they could not listen to the voice from the rest of the world. When this happens, the government can control what their nationals’ thinking. If there is no internet, the government will have more troubles to spread the information they want since they only have papers to do that which most people hate reading books. Another example is North Korea which also held by the Communist Party, their nationals are restricted to listen to the information(another problem is their communication technology is not good enough). They could just read it in books at school. So, although the internet helps spreader to spread information, a great ambitious authority can also use it to control people at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="What-can-we-do"><a href="#What-can-we-do" class="headerlink" title="What can we do?"></a>What can we do?</h3><p>There is a simple way to distinguish misleading information. Try not to rely on single-source, but attempt to find more sources of similar information and compare them together. If they have the same content, you may accept the information. But if they are confusing, we need to do some jobs to organize the information and see whether it is logically correct. At last, ask professionals if you still suspect the preciseness of the information.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The world is full of information. With the development of technology, we can now get rid of real-life activities and are able to seek information effortlessly. If we can use it precisely and correctly, it can be a wonderful tool to help us to deal with different tasks. But if we use it without thinking, it can lead you to a foolish place and stuck there forever. Therefore, remember to bring your brain while you are searching for information.</p>
